# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means 🎯

### 📊 About the Project

This project demonstrates **customer segmentation** using **unsupervised machine learning** techniques, specifically the **KMeans Clustering Algorithm**. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior within a **supermarket mall** context 🏬, allowing for more **targeted marketing strategies** 🎯. By segmenting customers based on their **spending patterns** 💸 and **demographics** 👥, the aim is to improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns and potentially boost **sales** 📈.

### 🗂️ Dataset Context

The dataset includes the following attributes:
- 🆔 **Customer ID**  
- 🎂 **Age**  
- 🚻 **Gender**  
- 💰 **Annual Income**  
- 🛒 **Spending Score**  

### 🔄 Process Overview

The analysis follows these key steps:

1. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyzing the dataset to understand its characteristics and uncover underlying patterns.
2. **🧹 Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and standardizing the data to prepare it for clustering.
3. **📌 KMeans Clustering** – The primary algorithm used for segmentation. The number of clusters is determined using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.
4. **📉 Dimensionality Reduction with PCA** – Applying **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensions of the dataset and visualize the clusters effectively.
5. **🔄 Compared multiple clustering algorithms like Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Clustering for better insights.
